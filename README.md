## BengaliSent: A Bangla Sentiment Dataset for Film Reviews and Its Evaluation

This project, **BengaliSent**, is inspired by the paper [*SentiGOLD: A Large Bangla Gold Standard Multi-Domain Sentiment Analysis Dataset and its Evaluation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06147) by Md. Ekramul Islam et al. SentiGOLD introduces a Bangla sentiment analysis dataset encompassing 70,000 samples from diverse sources, annotated by a gender-balanced team of linguists. However, SentiGOLD is not publicly available, motivating the creation of **BengaliSent**, a sentiment analysis dataset aimed at addressing the same need for Bangla language processing.

## Dataset
The **BengaliSent** dataset is now available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mirzaaa10/bengali_sent) for public access and research purposes.
